A **scalable end-to-end automation testing framework** built using
**Playwright + TypeScript** following modern test automation best practices.


# 📌 Project Overview

This repository demonstrates a **production-ready automation framework architecture** using **Playwright Test Runner** with **TypeScript**.

The framework is designed to support:

* Scalable automation architecture
* Cross-browser testing
* Reusable test utilities
* CI/CD pipeline integration
* Detailed reporting

This project serves as a **portfolio project showcasing modern automation engineering practices**.

A[Test Scripts] --> B[Page Object Model]
B --> C[Reusable Utilities]
B --> D[Test Data Layer]

C --> E[Playwright Test Runner]

E --> F[Browser Execution]
F --> G[Test Reports]

G --> H[Allure Reports]
```

The framework follows **clean architecture principles** where:

* Test logic is separated from page interactions
* Utilities are reusable across tests
* Data layer is externalized

# 🔁 CI/CD Pipeline

Automation tests run automatically using **GitHub Actions**.

CI pipeline executes on:

* Push to main branch
* Pull Requests

Pipeline steps:

1️⃣ Install dependencies
2️⃣ Install Playwright browsers
3️⃣ Execute test suite
4️⃣ Generate reports

Example workflow:

```
.github/workflows/playwright.yml
```

# 🧪 Example Test

```
test('Verify login functionality', async ({ page }) => {

  await page.goto('https://example.com')

  await page.fill('#username', 'testuser')
  await page.fill('#password', 'password')

  await page.click('#login')

  await expect(page).toHaveURL(/dashboard/)

})
```
